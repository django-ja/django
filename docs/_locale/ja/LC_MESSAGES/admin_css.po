"Django's dynamic admin interface gives you a fully-functional admin for free "
"with no hand-coding required. The dynamic admin is designed to be production-"
"ready, not just a starting point, so you can use it as-is on a real site. "
"While the underlying format of the admin pages is built in to Django, you "
"can customize the look and feel by editing the admin stylesheet and images."
